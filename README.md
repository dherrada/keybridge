Will it work with my computer?
- As long as the keyboard is less than or equal to 103mmX275mm (maybe a tiny bit bigger) it should work.

What bumpers do I use?
- I used these: https://www.adafruit.com/product/550 They say they're 8mm diameter but they were 6mm diameter by my measurments, so something around that size ought to work
